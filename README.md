# Musical Note Classifier ðŸŽµ

This project uses a deep learning model to classify musical notes based on their pitch and length. The Flask application allows users to deploy their own models and perform predictions interactively.

## Features
- Upload `.onnx` models for deployment.
- Classify uploaded images of musical notes.
- View prediction history with confidence scores.

## Hosted Application
The live application is hosted on Render:
[Musical Note Classifier](https://musical-note-classifier.onrender.com)

Note: if you want to run the model on the website, you will need to host the website locally. Instructions below.
